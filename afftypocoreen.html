        <h2>Korean Typographic poster 2022</h2>
        <p>
           Size 84,1 x 59,4 cm <br/>
           During my exchange semester in Korea, I had the opportunity to learn more about the history of Hangeul (Korean writing system). We studied old Korean books with their own font. We then had to use the font of one of the books to create <br/>a typographic poster illustrating a quote of our choice. We had to select the letters one by one to transform them and compose the words we needed. I chose the quote from Marc Twain: "They didn't know it was impossible so they did it".
